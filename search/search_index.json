Details about how the phenopackets were generated can be found in the  notebooks folder.  The folder is organized according to gene or collection. In some cases, the phenopackets were generated with other software,  and then we present a notebook that summarizes the phenopackets.</p>"},{"location":"developers/#generate-release-archive","title":"Generate release archive","text":"<p>All phenopackets are stored in subfolders of the notebooks folder, which is organized according to cohort.</p> <p>We use Phenopacket Store Toolkit (<code>ppktstore</code>) to package the phenopackets into a release ZIP file.</p> <p>Run the following in order to create the release ZIP archive.</p> <p>First, make sure to start in the top-level folder of the phenopacket store repository.

First, create a virtual environment (shown here as <code>my_venv</code>, but choose any name you like) and activate it.  Then, install the following packages:</p> <ul> <li><code>pyphetools</code> required for generating phenopackets</li> <li><code>ipykernel</code> for using <code>my_venv</code> as a Jupyter kernel</li> </ul> <pre><code># Create and activate the Python environment\nENV_NAME=my_venv\npython3 -m venv ${ENV_NAME}\nsource ${ENV_NAME}/bin/activate\n\n# Install both packages\npython3 -m pip install pyphetools ipykernel\n\n# Register the environment with Jupyter to use as a notebook kernel\npython3 -m ipykernel install --user --name ${ENV_NAME} --display-name \"Phenopacket Store Env\"\n</code></pre> <p>After the installation, a new kernel called <code>Phenopacket Store Env</code> should be available in Jupyter.
