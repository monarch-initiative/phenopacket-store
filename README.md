# phenopacket store

This repository offers cohorts of [GA4GH Phenopackets](https://phenopacket-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that
represent individuals with Mendelian diseases.

Please see the [online documentation](https://monarch-initiative.github.io/phenopacket-store) for information about available cohorts.

## Contributing

The cohorts were curated from data medical publications, mainly by parsing the tables or supplemental tables. 
The curation was done in Jupyter notebooks using [pyphetools](https://pypi.org/project/pyphetools/) library. 
Pull requests with additional notebooks in the same style are welcome.
